Learn how to manage Neon Organizations using the Neon API, including creating and using organization-specific API keys, creating projects, transferring projects, and retrieving consumption metrics.

You can authenticate your API requests using either of these methods:

- **Organization API key**: Automatically scopes all requests to your organization
- **Personal API key**: Requires including an `org_id` parameter to specify which organization you're working with

The key difference is in how you structure your API requests. Here's an example of listing projects using both methods:

Using an organization API key:

```bash
curl --request GET \
     --url 'https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/projects' \
     --header 'authorization: Bearer $ORG_API_KEY'
```

Using a personal API key:

```bash
curl --request GET \
     --url 'https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/projects?org_id=org-example-12345678' \
     --header 'authorization: Bearer $PERSONAL_API_KEY'
```

Both examples retrieve a list of projects, but notice how the personal API key request includes `org_id=org-example-12345678` to specify which organization's projects to list. With an organization API key, this parameter isn't needed because the key itself is already tied to a specific organization.

## Finding your org_id

To find your organization's `org_id`, navigate to your Organization's **Settings** page, where you'll find it under the **General information** section. Copy and use this ID in your API requests.

![finding your organization ID from the settings page](/docs/manage/orgs_id.png)

## Creating API keys

Only admins can create API keys for the organization. These keys provide admin-level access to all organization resources, including projects, members, and billing information. These are **user-independent** — they are not tied to a specific user. If any user leaves the organization, including the admin who created the API key, the API key remains active.

To create a new key, go to your organization’s settings and click the **Create new API key** button in the API keys section.

![creating an api key from the console](/docs/manage/org_api_keys.png)

## Organization management actions

The following examples use the **organization API key** for authentication. If you're using a **personal API key**, you'll need to include the `org_id` parameter to specify which organization you're working with.

### Get organization details

Retrieves information about your organization, including its name, plan, and creation date.

```bash shouldWrap
curl --request GET \
     --url 'https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/organizations' \
     --header 'authorization: Bearer $ORG_API_KEY'
```

Example response:

```json

## General project actions

These endpoints support both Organization API key and Personal API key authentication. If using a Personal API key, you need to include the `org_id` parameter to specify which organization you're working with.

The following examples use the **Organization API key** method.

### Creating projects

Creates a new project within your organization. You can specify:

- Postgres version
- Project name (optional)
- Region (optional)

```bash shouldWrap
curl --request POST \
     --url https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/projects \
     --header 'accept: application/json' \
     --header 'authorization: Bearer $ORG_API_KEY' \
     --header 'content-type: application/json' \
     --data '
{
  "project": {
    "pg_version": 16
  }
}
'
```

[Try in API Reference ↗](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/createproject)

### Listing projects

Lists all projects belonging to your organization, with a default limit of 10 projects per return:

```bash
curl --request GET \
     --url 'https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/projects?limit=10' \
     --header 'accept: application/json' \
     --header 'authorization: Bearer $ORG_API_KEY'
```

### Transfer projects

The Project Transfer API allows you to transfer projects from your personal Neon account to a specified organization account. See [Transfer projects via API](/docs/manage/orgs-project-transfer#transfer-projects-via-api) for details.

## Consumption metrics

You can use the Neon API to retrieve three types of consumption metrics for your organization:

<Admonition type="note">
Some metrics are only available on specific plans. Check the "Plan Availability" column for details.
</Admonition>

| Metric                                                                                           | Description                                                                              | Plan Availability |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| [Account-level](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/getconsumptionhistoryperaccount)            | Total usage across all projects in your organization                                     | Scale plan only   |
| [Project-level](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/getconsumptionhistoryperproject) (granular) | Project-level metrics available at hourly, daily, or monthly level of granularity        | Scale plan only   |
| [Project-level](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/listprojectsconsumption) (billing period)   | Consumption metrics for each project in your Organization for the current billing period | All plans         |

### Account-level metrics

To get global totals for all projects in the organization `org-ocean-art-12345678`, include the `org_id` in the `GET /consumption/projects` request. We also need to include:

- A start date
- An end date
- A level of granularity

In this case, we're asking for hourly metrics between June 30th and July 2nd, 2024.

```bash shouldWrap
curl --request GET \
     --url 'https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/consumption_history/account?from=2024-06-30T15%3A30%3A00Z&to=2024-07-02T15%3A30%3A00Z&granularity=hourly&org_id=org-ocean-art-12345678' \
     --header 'accept: application/json' \
     --header 'authorization: Bearer $ORG_API_KEY'
```

The response will provide aggregated hourly consumption metrics, including active time, compute time, written data, and synthetic storage size, for each hour between June 30 and July 2.

### Project-level metrics (granular)

You can also get similar daily, hourly, or monthly metrics across a selected time period, but broken out for each individual project that belongs to your organization.

Using the endpoint `GET /consumption_history/projects`, let's use the same start date, end date, and level of granularity as our account-level request: hourly metrics between June 30th and July 2nd, 2024.

```bash shouldWrap
curl --request GET \
     --url 'https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/consumption_history/projects?limit=10&from=2024-06-30T00%3A00%3A00Z&to=2024-07-02T00%3A00%3A00Z&granularity=hourly&org_id=org-ocean-art-12345678' \

### Project-level metrics (for the current billing period)

To get basic billing period-based consumption metrics for each project in the organization `org-ocean-art-12345678`, include `org_id` in the `GET /projects` request for consumption metrics:

```bash shouldWrap
curl --request GET \
     --url 'https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/projects?org_id=org-ocean-art-12345678' \
     --header 'accept: application/json' \
     --header 'authorization: Bearer $ORG_API_KEY'
```

See more details about using this endpoint on the [Manage billing with consumption limits](/docs/guides/partner-consumption-limits#retrieving-metrics-for-all-projects) page in our Partner Guide.

## List all organizations you belong to

You can use the `GET /users/me/organizations` request to retrieve a list of all organizations associated with your personal account.

```bash shouldWrap
