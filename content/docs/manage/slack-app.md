## Example workflows

### Check your Neon usage statistics

Open a DM with the Neon Slack App and run the following command to instantly view your current data transfer, compute time, and storage usage across all projects:

```
/neon usage
```

<img src="/docs/manage/slack_app_usage.png" alt="results of /neon usage showing compute, storage, and data transfer" style={{ display: "block", margin: "1rem 0", width: "80%" }} />

### Switching between organizations

To take actions on behalf of a specific organization, set your context using the following command:

```bash
/neon set org
```

When finished, you can return to your personal view by clearing your defaults:

```bash
/neon clear org
```

### Usage notifications

In addition to checking usage on demand, the Neon Slack App will automatically notify you when you approach or reach your resource limits for compute hours, storage, or data transfer.
