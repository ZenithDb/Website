A single read-write compute endpoint is created for your project's [primary branch](/docs/reference/glossary#primary-branch), by default.

To connect to a database that resides in a branch, you must connect via a compute endpoint associated with the branch. The following diagram shows the project's primary branch (`main`) and a child branch, both of which have an associated compute endpoint.

```text
Project
    |----primary branch (main) ---- compute endpoint <--- application/client
             |    |
             |    |---- database (neondb)
             |
             ---- child branch ---- compute endpoint <--- application/client
                            |
                            |---- database (mydb)
```

Neon supports both read-write and read-only compute endpoints. Read-only compute endpoints are also referred to as [Read replicas](/docs/introduction/read-replicas). A branch can have a single read-write compute endpoint but supports multiple read-only compute endpoints.

Tier limits define resources (vCPUs and RAM) available to a compute endpoint. The Neon [Free Tier](/docs/introduction/free-tier) provides a shared vCPU and up to 1 GB of RAM per compute endpoint. The [Neon Pro plan](/docs/introduction/pro-plan) supports larger compute sizes and _Autoscaling_.

## View a compute endpoint

A compute endpoint is associated with a branch. To view a compute endpoint, select **Branches** in the Neon Console, and select a branch. If the branch has a compute endpoint, it is shown on the branch page.

Compute endpoint details shown on the branch page include:

- **Id**: The compute endpoint ID.
-- **Type**: The type of compute endpoint. `R/W` (Read-write) or `R/O` (Read-only).
- **Compute size**: The size of the compute endpoint. Neon [Pro plan](/docs/introduction/pro-plan) users can configure the amount of vCPU and RAM for a compute endpoint when creating or editing a compute endpoint. Shows _Autoscaling_ minimum and maximum vCPU values if _Autoscaling_ is enabled.
- **Auto-suspend delay**: The number of seconds of inactivity after which a compute endpoint is automatically suspended. The default is 300 seconds (5 minutes). For more information, see [Auto-suspend configuration](#auto-suspend-configuration).
- **Last active**: The date and time the compute was last active.
- **Status**: The compute endpoint status (`Active`, `Idle`, or `Stopped`).

## Create a compute endpoint

You can only create a read-write compute endpoint for a branch that does not have one, but a branch can have multiple read-only compute endpoints (referred to as "read replicas"). [Read replicas](/docs/guides/read-replica-guide) are a [Neon Pro plan](/docs/introduction/pro-plan) feature.

To create an endpoint:

1. In the Neon Console, select **Branches**.
1. Select a branch that does not have an endpoint
1. Click **Add compute**.
1. On the **Create compute endpoint** dialog, specify your settings and click **Create**. Selecting **Read-only** creates a [Read replica](/docs/introduction/read-replicas).

## Edit a compute endpoint

Neon paid plan users can edit a compute endpoint to change the [compute size](#compute-size-and-autoscaling-configuration) or [Auto-suspend](#auto-suspend-configuration) configuration.

To edit a compute endpoint:

1. In the Neon Console, select **Branches**.
1. Select a branch.
1. Click the kebab menu in the **Computes** table, and select **Edit**.
1. Specify your changes and click **Save**.

### Compute size and Autoscaling configuration

Neon [Pro plan](/docs/introduction/pro-plan) users can change compute size settings when [editing a compute endpoint](#edit-a-compute-endpoint).

_Compute size_ is the number of Compute Units (CUs) assigned to a Neon compute endpoint. The number of CUs determines the processing capacity of the compute endpoint. One CU has 1 vCPU and 4 GB of RAM, 2 CUs have 2 vCPUs and 8 GB of RAM, and so on. The amount of RAM in GBs is always 4 times the number of CUs, as shown in the table below. Currently, a Neon compute can have anywhere from 1/4 (.25) to 7 CUs.

| Compute Units | vCPU | RAM    |
|:--------------|:-----|:-------|
| .25           | .25  | 1 GB   |
| .5            | .5   | 2 GB   |
| 1             | 1    | 4 GB   |
| 2             | 2    | 8 GB   |
| 3             | 3    | 12 GB  |
| 4             | 4    | 16 GB  |
| 5             | 5    | 20 GB  |
| 6             | 6    | 24 GB  |
| 7             | 7    | 28 GB  |

Neon supports two compute size configuration options:

- **Fixed Size:** This option allows you to select a fixed compute size ranging from .25 CUs to 7 CUs. A fixed-size compute does not scale to meet workload demand.
- **Autoscaling:** This option allows you to specify a minimum and maximum compute size. Neon scales the compute size up and down within the selected compute size boundaries to meet workload demand. _Autoscaling_ currently supports a range of 1/4 (.25) to 7 CUs. For information about how Neon implements the _Autoscaling_ feature, see [Autoscaling](/docs/introduction/autoscaling).

<Admonition type="info">
The `neon_utils` extension provides a `num_cpus()` function you can use to monitor how the _Autoscaling_ feature allocates compute resources in response to workload. For more information, see [The neon_utils extension](/docs/extensions/neon-utils).
</Admonition>

### Auto-suspend configuration

Neon's _Auto-suspend_ feature automatically transitions a compute endpoint into an `Idle` state after a period of inactivity, also known as "scale-to-zero". By default, suspension occurs after 5 minutes of inactivity, but this delay can be adjusted. For instance, you can increase the delay to reduce the frequency of suspensions, or you can disable _Auto-suspend_ completely to maintain an "always-active" compute endpoint. An "always-active" configuration eliminates the few seconds of latency required to reactivate a compute endpoint but is likely to increase your compute time usage.

The maximum **Auto-suspend delay** setting is 604800 seconds (7 days), and the following settings have a special meaning:

- `0` means use the default setting (5 minutes / 300 seconds).
- `-1` means never suspend the compute endpoint.

## Delete a compute endpoint

Deleting a compute endpoint is a permanent action.

To delete a compute endpoint:

1. In the Neon Console, select **Branches**.
1. Select a branch.
1. Click the kebab menu in the **Computes** table, and select **Delete**.
1. On the confirmation dialog, click **Delete**.

## Manage compute endpoints with the Neon API

Compute endpoint actions performed in the Neon Console can also be performed using the [Neon API](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/getting-started-with-neon-api). The following examples demonstrate how to create, view, update, and delete compute endpoints using the Neon API. For other compute endpoint API methods, refer to the [Neon API reference](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/getting-started-with-neon-api).

<Admonition type="note">
The API examples that follow may not show all of the user-configurable request body attributes that are available to you. To view all attributes for a particular method, refer to method's request body schema in the [Neon API reference](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/getting-started-with-neon-api).
</Admonition>

The `jq` option specified in each example is an optional third-party tool that formats the `JSON` response, making it easier to read. For information about this utility, see [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/).

### Prerequisites

A Neon API request requires an API key. For information about obtaining an API key, see [Create an API key](/docs/manage/api-keys#create-an-api-key). In the cURL examples below, `$NEON_API_KEY` is specified in place of an actual API key, which you must provide when making a Neon API request.

### Create a compute endpoint with the API

The following Neon API method creates a compute endpoint.

```text
POST /projects/{project_id}/endpoints
```

The API method appears as follows when specified in a cURL command. The branch you specify cannot have an existing compute endpoint. A compute endpoint must be associated with a branch, and a branch can have only one compute endpoint. Neon  supports read-write and read-only compute endpoints. Read-only compute endpoints are for creating [Read replicas](/docs/introduction/read-replicas). A branch can have a single read-write compute endpoint but supports multiple read-only compute endpoints.

```bash
curl -X 'POST' \
  'https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/projects/hidden-cell-763301/endpoints' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer $NEON_API_KEY' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
