Neon provides support for the [@neondatabase/api-client](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@neondatabase/api-client) library, which is a wrapper for the [Neon API](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/getting-started-with-neon-api). It provides a convenient way to interact with the Neon API using TypeScript.

## Installation

You can install the library using `npm` or `yarn`.

`npm`:

```bash
npm install @neondatabase/api-client
```

`yarn`:

```bash
yarn add @neondatabase/api-client
```

## Get Started

To get started with the `@neondatabase/api-client` library, follow these steps:

1. Obtain an API key from the [Account settings](https://console.neon.tech/app/settings/api-keys) page in the Neon Console.

2. Click **Generate new API key**.

3. Enter a name for your API key and click **Create**.

4. Save your API key to a secure location that enables you to pass it to your code.

5. Import the library:

   ```typescript
   import { createApiClient } from '@neondatabase/api-client';
   ```

6. Create an instance of the API client by calling the `createApiClient` function:

    ```typescript
    const apiClient = createApiClient({
    apiKey: 'your-api-key',
    });
    ```

7. Use the `apiClient` instance to make API calls. For example:

    ```typescript
    const response = await apiClient.listProjects({});
    console.log(response);
    ```
