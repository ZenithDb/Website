Neon's plans are designed to meet different user requirements, ranging from hobby projects to enterprise-level production workloads. We also offer custom enterprise plans with volume-based discounts for large teams or database fleets. Refer to our [Pricing](https://neon.tech/pricing) page for fees and a detailed plan comparison.

Neon offers four plans:

- [Free Tier](#free-tier)
- [Launch](#launch)
- [Scale](#scale)
- [Enterprise](#enterprise)

<Admonition type="tip" title="Plan Allowances and Extra Usage">
Neon plans are structured around **Allowances** and **Extra usage**. Allowances are included in your plan. With Neon's paid plans, you can purchase [extra usage](/docs/introduction/extra-usage) in set increments for when you need to go over your allowance.

## Free Tier

Neon's Free Tier plan is best for hobby projects, prototypes, and learning Neon.

### Free Tier allowances

The Free Tier includes the following usage allowances:

| Usage type                 | Plan allowance                                                                                                                                         |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Projects**               | 1 Neon project                                                                                                                                         |
| **Branches**               | 10 branches                                                                                                                                            |
| **Databases**              | Unlimited                                                                                                                                              |
| **Storage**                | 0.5 GiB                                                                                                                                                |
| **Compute**                | Always-available default branch compute, 5 compute hours (20 _active hours_)/month on branch computes. Free Tier computes have 0.25 vCPU with 1GB RAM. |
| **Data transfer (Egress)** | 5 GB per month                                                                                                                                         |

<Admonition type="tip" title="What are active hours and compute hours?">

- An **active hour** is a measure of the amount of time a compute is active. The time your compute is idle when suspended due to inactivity is not counted. In the table above, _active hours_ are based on a 0.25 vCPU compute size.
- A **compute hour** is one _active hour_ for a compute with 1 vCPU. For a compute with .25 vCPU, it takes 4 _active hours_ to use 1 compute hour. On the other hand, if your compute has 4 vCPUs, it takes only 15 minutes to use 1 compute hour.
- **Compute hours formula**

  ```
  compute hours = compute size * active hours
  ```

</Admonition>

### Free Tier features

- Autosuspend (after 5 minutes of inactivity)
- All supported regions
- Project sharing
- Advanced Postgres features such as connection pooling, logical replication, and 60+ Postgres extensions
- Neon features such as branching, point-in-time restore up to **24 hours** in the past, time travel connections, and more
- [Community support](/docs/introduction/support)

For a complete list of features, refer to the **detailed plan comparison** on the [Neon pricing](https://neon.tech/pricing) page.

<Admonition type="tip" title="Free Tier Compute Allowances">
On the Free Tier, your default branch compute is always available â€” it will never be suspended, which means you can always access the data on the default branch in your Neon project. Branch computes have 20 [active hours](/docs/reference/glossary#active-time) (5 [compute hours](/docs/reference/glossary#compute-hour)) per month. If your branch computes exceed this allowance, they are suspended until the allowance resets at the beginning of the month. You can monitor branch compute hours on the [Billing page](/docs/introduction/manage-billing#view-the-billing-page) in the Neon Console. The compute hour allowance for branch computes resets at the beginning of each month. For instance, if you enrolled in the Neon Free Tier in January, the allowance for branch computes resets on February 1st.
