A Neon read replica is an independent read-only compute instance that performs read operations on the same data as your read-write compute, which means adding a read replica to a Neon project requires no additional storage.

A key benefit of read replicas is that you can distribute read requests to one or more read replica compute instances, enabling you to easily scale your applications and achieve higher throughput for both read-write and read-only workloads.

For more information about Neon's read replica feature, see [Read replicas](/docs/introduction/read-replicas).

In this guide, we'll show you how you can leverage Neon read replicas to efficiently scale Prisma applications using Prisma Client's read replica extension: [@prisma/extension-read-replicas](https://github.com/prisma/extension-read-replicas).

## Prerequisites

- An application that uses Prisma with a Neon database.
- A [Neon Pro plan](/docs/introduction/pro-plan) account. Read replicas are a Neon Pro plan feature.

## Create a read replica

You can create one or more read replicas for any branch in your Neon project. Creating a read replica involves adding a read-only compute endpoint to the Neon branch. You can add a read-only compute endpoint by following these steps:

1. In the Neon Console, select **Branches**.
2. Select the branch where your database resides.
3. Click **Add compute**.
4. On the **Create Compute Endpoint** dialog, select **Read-only** as the **Compute type**.
5. Specify the **Compute size** options. You can configure a **Fixed Size** compute with a specific amount of vCPU and RAM (the default) or enable **Autoscaling** and configure a minimum and maximum compute size. You can also configure the **Auto-suspend delay** period, which is the amount of idle time after which your read-only compute is transitioned to an idle state. The default setting is 300 seconds (5 minutes). You can set this value up to 604800 seconds (7 days).
    <Admonition type="note">
    The compute size configuration determines the processing power of your database. More vCPU and memory means more processing power but also higher compute costs. For information about compute costs, see [Billing metrics](/docs/introduction/billing).
    </Admonition>
6. When you finish making selections, click **Create**.

   Your read-only compute is provisioned and appears in the **Computes** section of the **Branches** page.

Alternatively, you can create read replicas using the [Neon API](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/createprojectendpoint) or [Neon CLI](/docs/reference/cli-branches#create).

```bash
curl --request POST \
     --url https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/projects/late-bar-27572981/endpoints \
     --header 'accept: application/json' \
     --header 'authorization: Bearer $NEON_API_KEY' \
     --header 'content-type: application/json' \
     --data '
{
  "endpoint": {
    "type": "read_only",
    "branch_id": "br-young-fire-15282225"
  }
}
' | jq
```

```bash
neonctl branches add-compute mybranch --type read_only
```

</CodeTabs>

## Retrieve the connection string for your read replica

Connecting to a read replica is the same as connecting to any branch in a Neon project, except you connect via a read-only compute endpoint instead of a read-write compute endpoint. The following steps describe how to retrieve the connection string (the URL) for a read replica from the Neon Console.

1. On the Neon **Dashboard**, under **Connection Details**, select the branch, the database, and the role you want to connect with.
1. Under **Compute**, select your **Read-only** compute endpoint.
1. Select the connection string and copy it. This is the information you need to connect to the read replica from your Prisma Client. The connection string appears similar to the following:

    <CodeBlock shouldWrap>

    ```bash
    postgres://alex:AbC123dEf@ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/dbname
    ```

    </CodeBlock>

    If you expect a high number of connections, select **Pooled connection** to add the `-pooler` flag to the connection string, but remember to append `?pgbouncer=true` to the connection string when using a pooled connection. Prisma requires this flag when using Prisma Client with PgBouncer. See [Connect from serverless functions](/docs/guides/prisma#connect-from-serverless-functions) for more information.

## Update your env file

In your `.env` file, set a `DATABASE_REPLICA_URL` environment variable to the connection string of your read replica. Your `.env` file should look something like this, with your regular `DATABASE_URL` and the newly added `DATABASE_REPLICA_URL`.

```text
DATABASE_URL="postgres://alex:AbC123dEf@ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/dbname"
DATABASE_REPLICA_URL="postgres://alex:AbC123dEf@ep-damp-cell-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/dbname"
```

Notice that the `endpoint_id` (`ep-damp-cell-123456`) for the read replica compute differs. The read replica is a different compute instance and therefore has a different `endpoint_id`.

## Configure Prisma Client to use a read replica

[@prisma/extension-read-replicas](https://github.com/prisma/extension-read-replicas) adds support to Prisma Client for read replicas. The following steps show you how to install the extension and configure it to use a Neon read replica.

1. Install the extension in your Prisma project:

    ```bash
    npm install @prisma/extension-read-replicas
    ```

2. Extend your Prisma Client instance by importing the extension and adding the `DATABASE_REPLICA_URL` environment variable as shown:

    ```javascript
    import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client'
    import { readReplicas } from '@prisma/extension-read-replicas'

    const prisma = new PrismaClient()
    .$extends(
        readReplicas({
        url: DATABASE_REPLICA_URL,
        }),
    )
    ```

    <Admonition type="note">
    You can also pass an array of read replica connection strings if you want to use multiple read replicas. Neon supports adding multiple read replicas to a database branch.

    ```javascript
    // lib/prisma.ts
    const prisma = new PrismaClient()
    .$extends(
    readReplicas({
        url: [
        process.env.DATABASE_REPLICA_URL_1,
        process.env.DATABASE_REPLICA_URL_2,
        ],
    }),
    )
    ```

    </Admonition>

    When your application runs, read operations are sent to the read replica. If you specify multiple read replicas, a read replica is selected randomly.

    All write and `$transaction` queries are sent to the primary compute endpoint defined by `DATABASE_URL`, which is your read/write compute endpoint.

    If you want to read from the primary compute endpoint and bypass read replicas, you can use the `$primary()` method in your extended Prisma Client instance:

    ```bash
    const posts = await prisma.$primary().post.findMany()
    ```

    This Prisma Client query will be routed to your primary database.

## Examples

This example demonstrates how to use the [@prisma/extension-read-replicas](https://github.com/prisma/extension-read-replicas) extension in Prisma Client. It uses a simple TypeScript script to read and write data in a Postgres database.
