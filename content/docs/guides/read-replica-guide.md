[Read replicas](/docs/introduction/read-replicas) are supported with the [Neon Pro plan](/docs/introduction/pro-plan). This guide will lead you through the process of creating and managing read replicas.

The general methodology of using read replicas to segregate read-only work from your production database operations can be applied to a variety of uses cases, such as:

- Offloading analytics or reporting queries
- Distributing read requests to achieve higher throughput
- Providing read-only data access to specific users or applications who do not need to modify data
- Configuring different CPU and memory resources for each read replica for different users and applications

Regardless of the application, the steps for creating, configuring, and connecting to a read replica are the same. You can create one or more read replicas for any branch in your Neon project and configure the vCPU and memory allocated to each. Neon's _Autoscaling_ and _Auto-suspend_ features are also supported, providing you with control over compute usage.

Neon supports managing read replicas programmatically using the Neon API. See [Manage read replicas using the Neon API](#manage-read-replicas-using-the-neon-api).

## Prerequisites

- A [Pro plan](/docs/introduction/pro-plan) account.
- A [Neon project](/docs/manage/projects#create-a-project).

## Create a read replica

Creating a read replica involves adding a read-only compute endpoint to a branch. You can add a read-only compute endpoint to any branch in your Neon project by following these steps:

1. In the Neon Console, select **Branches**.
2. Select the branch where your database resides.
3. Click **Add compute**.
4. On the **Create Compute Endpoint** dialog, select **Read-only** as the **Compute type**.
5. Specify the **Compute size** options. You can configure a **Fixed Size** compute with a specific amount of vCPU and RAM (the default) or enable **Autoscaling** and configure a minimum and maximum compute size. You can also configure the **Auto-suspend delay** period, which is the amount of idle time after which your read-only compute is transitioned to an idle state. The default setting is 300 seconds (5 minutes). You can set this value up to 604800 seconds (7 days).
    <Admonition type="note">
    The compute size configuration determines the processing power of your database. More vCPU and memory means more processing power but also higher compute costs. For information about compute costs, see [Billing metrics](/docs/introduction/billing).
    </Admonition>
6. When you have finished making your selections, click **Create**.

In a few moments, your read-only compute is provisioned and appears in the **Computes** section of the **Branches** page. This is your read replica. The following section describes how to connect to your read replica.

Alternatively, you can create read replicas using the [Neon API](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/createprojectendpoint) or [Neon CLI](/docs/reference/cli-branches#create).

<CodeTabs labels={["API", "CLI"]}>

```bash
curl --request POST \
     --url https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/projects/late-bar-27572981/endpoints \
     --header 'accept: application/json' \
     --header 'authorization: Bearer $NEON_API_KEY' \
     --header 'content-type: application/json' \
     --data '
{
  "endpoint": {
    "type": "read_only",
    "branch_id": "br-young-fire-15282225"
  }
}
' | jq
```

```bash
neonctl branches add-compute mybranch --type read_only
```

</CodeTabs>

## Connect to a read replica

Connecting to a read replica is the same as connecting to any branch, except you connect via a read-only compute endpoint instead of a read-write compute endpoint. The following steps describe how to connect to your read replica with connection details obtained from the Neon Console.

1. On the Neon **Dashboard**, under **Connection Details**, select the branch, the database, and the role you want to connect with.
1. Under **Compute**, select a **Read-only** compute endpoint.
1. Select a connection string or a code example from the drop-down menu and copy it. This is the information you need to connect to the read replica from you client or application.

    A **psql** connection string appears similar to the following:

    <CodeBlock shouldWrap>

    ```bash
    postgres://[user]:[password]@[neon_hostname]/[dbname]
    ```

    </CodeBlock>

    If you expect a high number of connections, select **Pooled connection** to add the `-pooler` flag to the connection string or example.

    When you use a read-only connection string, you are connecting to a read replica. No write operations are permitted on this connection.

## Viewing read replicas

To view read replicas for a branch, select **Branches** in the Neon Console, and select a branch. Under the **Computes** heading, the **Type** field identifies your read replicas. Read replicas have a `R/O` value instead of `R/W`.

## Edit a read replica

You can edit your read replica to change the [Compute size](/docs/manage/endpoints#compute-size-and-autoscaling-configuration) or [Auto-suspend](/docs/manage/endpoints#auto-suspend-configuration) configuration.

To edit a read-only compute endpoint:

1. In the Neon Console, select **Branches**.
1. Select a branch.
1. Under **Computes**, identify the read-only compute endpoint you want to modify, click the compute endpoint kebab menu, and select **Edit**.
1. Specify your **Compute size** or **Auto-suspend delay** changes and click **Save**.

## Delete a read replica

Deleting a read replica is a permanent action, but you can quickly create a new read replica if you need one.
To delete a read replica:

1. In the Neon Console, select **Branches**.
1. Select a branch.
1. Under **Computes**, find the read-only compute endpoint you want to delete. Read replicas have a `R/O` type.
1. Click the compute endpoint kebab menu, and select **Delete**.
1. On the confirmation dialog, click **Delete**.

## Manage read replicas using the Neon API

In Neon, a read replica is implemented as a read-only compute endpoint. The following examples demonstrate creating and deleting read-only compute endpoints using the Neon API. The Neon API also supports get, list, edit, start, and suspend API methods. For information about those methods, refer to the [Neon API reference](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/getting-started-with-neon-api).

<Admonition type="note">
The API examples that follow only show some of the user-configurable request body attributes that are available to you. To view all attributes, refer to the method's request body schema in the [Neon API reference](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/getting-started-with-neon-api).

### Prerequisites

A Neon API request requires an API key. For information about obtaining an API key, see [Create an API key](/docs/manage/api-keys#create-an-api-key). In the cURL examples below, `$NEON_API_KEY` is specified in place of an actual API key. You must replace this value with an actual API key when making a Neon API request.

### Create a read replica with the API

The following Neon API method creates a read-only compute endpoint.

```text
POST /projects/{project_id}/endpoints
```

The API method appears as follows when specified in a cURL command. A compute endpoint must be associated with a branch. A branch can only have a single read-write endpoint but can have multiple read-only compute endpoints. The `type` attribute in the following example specifies `read_only`, which creates a read-only compute endpoint:

```bash
curl -X 'POST' \
  'https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/projects/hidden-cell-763301/endpoints' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer $NEON_API_KEY' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
  "endpoint": {
    "branch_id": "br-blue-tooth-671580",
    "type": "read_only"
  }
}'
```

For information about obtaining the required `project_id` and `branch_id` parameters, refer to [Create an endpoint](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/createprojectendpoint), in the _Neon API reference_.

### Delete a read replica with the API

The following Neon API method deletes the specified compute endpoint. Compute endpoints are identified by their `branch_id` and `endpoint_id`, regardless of whether they are read-write or read-only. To view the API documentation for this method, refer to the [Neon API reference](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/deleteprojectendpoint).

```text
DELETE /projects/{project_id}/endpoints/{endpoint_id}
```

The API method appears as follows when specified in a cURL command.

```bash
curl -X 'DELETE' \
  'https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/projects/hidden-cell-763301/endpoints/ep-young-art-646685' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer $NEON_API_KEY'
```

For information about obtaining the required `project_id` and `endpoint_id` parameters, refer to [Delete an endpoint](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/deleteprojectendpoint), in the _Neon API reference_.
