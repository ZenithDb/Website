<Admonition type="note">
Logical replication in Neon is currently in Beta. We welcome your feedback to help improve this feature. You can provide feedback via the [Feedback](https://console.neon.tech/app/projects?modal=feedback) form in the Neon Console or by reaching out to us on [Discord](https://t.co/kORvEuCUpJ).

Logical replication enables replicating data from your Neon database to external destinations, allowing for Change Data Capture (CDC) and real-time analytics. Stream your data to data warehouses, analytical database services, messaging platforms, event-streaming platforms, external Postgres databases, and more.

Logical replication in Neon works like it does on any standard Postgres installation. It uses a publish and subscribe model to replicate data from the source database to the destination.

Replication starts by copying a snapshot of the data from the publisher to the subscriber. Once this is done, subsequent changes are sent to the subscriber as they occur in real-time.

To get started, jump into one of our step-by-step [logical replication guides](#logical-replication-guides).
