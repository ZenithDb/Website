Neon has successfully achieved both SOC 2 Type 1 and Type 2 compliance, demonstrating our commitment to data security and privacy. These compliance milestones, validated by independent auditors, affirm our adherence to the criteria set forth by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) in the areas of security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy.

The **SOC 2 Type 1 Compliance** audit assessed the design of our controls at a specific point in time. This evaluation verified that our systems and procedures are suitably designed to meet the AICPA's trust service criteria.

The **SOC 2 Type 2 Compliance** audit assessed the operational effectiveness of these controls over a period of time. This comprehensive audit provides assurance that our controls are not only well-designed but also consistently applied and effective in practice.

Achieving SOC 2 Type 1 and Type 2 compliance underscores Neon's ongoing commitment to safeguarding customer data and maintaining a high level of security. We will continue to invest in regular audits and adhere to industry best practices to ensure the security, integrity, and privacy of the data you entrust us with.
