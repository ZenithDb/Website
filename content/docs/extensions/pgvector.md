The `pgvector` extension enables you to store vector embeddings and perform vector similarity search in Postgres. It is particularly useful for applications involving natural language processing, such as those built on top of OpenAI's GPT models. 

`pgvector` supports:

- Exact and approximate nearest neighbor search
- Single-precision, half-precision, binary, and sparse vectors
- L2 distance, inner product, cosine distance, L1 distance, Hamming distance, and Jaccard distance
- Any language with a Postgres client
- ACID compliance, point-in-time recovery, JOINs, and all other features of Postgres

This topic describes how to enable the `pgvector` extension in Neon and how to create, store, and query vectors.

## Enable the pgvector extension

You can enable the `pgvector` extension by running the following `CREATE EXTENSION` statement in the Neon **SQL Editor** or from a client such as `psql` that is connected to Neon.

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION vector;
```

For information about using the Neon SQL Editor, see [Query with Neon's SQL Editor](/docs/get-started-with-neon/query-with-neon-sql-editor). For information about using the `psql` client with Neon, see [Connect with psql](/docs/connect/query-with-psql-editor).

## Create a table to store vectors

To create a table for storing vectors, use the following SQL command, adjusting the dimensions as needed.

```sql
CREATE TABLE items (
  id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  embedding VECTOR(3)
);
```

The command generates a table named `items` with an `embedding` column capable of storing vectors with 3 dimensions. OpenAI's `text-embedding-ada-002` model supports 1536 dimensions for each piece of text, which creates more accurate embeddings for natural language processing tasks. For more information about embeddings, see [Embeddings](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings/what-are-embeddings), in the _OpenAI documentation_.

## Storing vectors and embeddings

After you have generated an embedding using a service like the OpenAI API, you can store the resulting vector in your database. Using a Postgres client library in your preferred programming language, you can execute an `INSERT` statement similar to the following to store embeddings.

This command inserts two new rows into the `items` table with the provided embeddings.

```sql
INSERT INTO items (embedding) VALUES ('[1,2,3]'), ('[4,5,6]');
```

This command loads vectors in bulk using the `COPY` command:

```sql
COPY items (embedding) FROM STDIN WITH (FORMAT BINARY);
```

For a Python script example, see [bulk_loading.py](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector-python/blob/master/examples/bulk_loading.py).

This command how how to upserts vectors:

```sql
INSERT INTO items (id, embedding) VALUES (1, '[1,2,3]'), (2, '[4,5,6]')
    ON CONFLICT (id) DO UPDATE SET embedding = EXCLUDED.embedding;
```

This command shows how to update vectors:

```sql
UPDATE items SET embedding = '[1,2,3]' WHERE id = 1;
```

This command shows how to delete vectors:

```sql
DELETE FROM items WHERE id = 1;
```

## Querying vectors

To retrieve vectors and calculate similarity, use `SELECT` statements and the built-in vector operators. For instance, you can find the top 5 most similar items to a given embedding using the following query:

```sql
SELECT * FROM items ORDER BY embedding <-> '[3,1,2]' LIMIT 5;
```

This query computes the Euclidean distance (L2 distance) between the given vector and the vectors stored in the items table, sorts the results by the calculated distance, and returns the top 5 most similar items.

Supported distance functions include:

- `<->` - L2 distance
- `<#>` - (negative) inner product
- `<=>` - cosine distance
- `<+>` - L1 distance (added in 0.7.0)

<Admonition type="note">
The inner product operator (`<#>`) returns the negative inner product since Postgres only supports `ASC` order index scans on operators.
</Admonition>

Get the nearest neighbors to a row:

```sql
SELECT * FROM items WHERE id != 1 ORDER BY embedding <-> (SELECT embedding FROM items WHERE id = 1) LIMIT 5;
```

Get rows within a certain distance:

```sql
SELECT * FROM items WHERE embedding <-> '[3,1,2]' < 5;```
```

<Admonition type="note">
Combine with ORDER BY and LIMIT to use an index
</Admonition>

Get the distance:

```sql
SELECT embedding <-> '[3,1,2]' AS distance FROM items;
```

For inner product, multiply by `-1` (since `<#>` returns the negative inner product):

```sql
SELECT (embedding <#> '[3,1,2]') * -1 AS inner_product FROM items;
```

For cosine similarity, use 1 - cosine distance:

```sql
SELECT 1 - (embedding <=> '[3,1,2]') AS cosine_similarity FROM items;
```

To average vectors:

```sql
SELECT AVG(embedding) FROM items;
```

To average groups of vectors:

```sql
SELECT category_id, AVG(embedding) FROM items GROUP BY category_id;
```

## Indexing vectors

By default, `pgvector` performs exact nearest neighbor search, providing perfect recall. Adding an index on the vector column can improve query performance with a minor cost in recall.

Supported index types include:

- [HNSW](#hnsw)
- [IVFFLAT](#ivfflat)

### HNSW

An HNSW index creates a multilayer graph. It has better query performance than IVFFlat (in terms of speed-recall tradeoff), but has slower build times and uses more memory. Also, an index can be created without any data in the table since there isn’t a training step like IVFFlat.

The following examples show how to add an HNSW index for the supported distance functions. The supported types include:

- `vector` - up to 2,000 dimensions
- `halfvec` - up to 4,000 dimensions (added in 0.7.0)
- `bit` - up to 64,000 dimensions (added in 0.7.0)
- `sparsevec` - up to 1,000 non-zero elements (added in 0.7.0)

**L2 distance**

```sql
CREATE INDEX ON items USING hnsw (embedding vector_l2_ops);
```
<Admonition type="note">
Use `halfvec_l2_ops` for `halfvec` and `sparsevec_l2_ops` for `sparsevec` (and similar for the other distance functions).
</Admonition>


**Inner product**

```sql
CREATE INDEX ON items USING hnsw (embedding vector_ip_ops);
```

**Cosine distance**

```sql
CREATE INDEX ON items USING hnsw (embedding vector_cosine_ops);
```

**L1 distance - added in 0.7.0**

```sql
CREATE INDEX ON items USING hnsw (embedding vector_l1_ops);
```

**Hamming distance - added in 0.7.0**

```sql
CREATE INDEX ON items USING hnsw (embedding bit_hamming_ops);
```

**Jaccard distance - added in 0.7.0**

```sql
CREATE INDEX ON items USING hnsw (embedding bit_jaccard_ops);
```

#### HNSW index options

- `m` - the max number of connections per layer (16 by default)
- `ef_construction` - the size of the dynamic candidate list for constructing the graph (64 by default)

This example demonstrates how to set the parameters:

```sql 
CREATE INDEX ON items USING hnsw (embedding vector_l2_ops) WITH (m = 16, ef_construction = 64);
```

A higher value of `ef_construction` provides better recall at the cost of index build time and insert speed.

#### HNSW query options

You can specify the size of the dynamic candidate list for search. The size is 40 by default.

```sql
SET hnsw.ef_search = 100;
```

A higher value provides better recall at the cost of speed.

This query shows how to use `SET LOCAL` inside a transaction to set `ef_search` for a single query:

```sql
BEGIN;
SET LOCAL hnsw.ef_search = 100;
SELECT ...
COMMIT;
```

### IVFFlat

An IVFFlat index divides vectors into lists and searches a subset of those lists that are closest to the query vector. It has faster build times and uses less memory than HNSW, but has lower query performance with respect to the speed-recall tradeoff.

Keys to achieving good recall include:

- Creating the index after the table has some data
- Choosing an appropriate number of lists. A good starting point is rows/1000 for up to 1M rows and `sqrt(rows)` for over 1M rows.
- Specify an appropriate number of probes when querying. A higher number is better for recall, and a lower is better for speed. A good starting point is `sqrt(lists)`.

Supported types include:

- `vector` - up to 2,000 dimensions
- `halfvec` - up to 4,000 dimensions (added in 0.7.0)
- `bit` - up to 64,000 dimensions (added in 0.7.0)

The following examples show how to add an index for each distance function:

**L2 distance**

CREATE INDEX ON items USING ivfflat (embedding vector_l2_ops) WITH (lists = 100);

<Admonition type="note">
Use `halfvec_l2_ops` for halfvec (and similar with the other distance functions).
</Admonition> 

**Inner product**

```sql
CREATE INDEX ON items USING ivfflat (embedding vector_ip_ops) WITH (lists = 100);
```

**Cosine distance**

```sql
CREATE INDEX ON items USING ivfflat (embedding vector_cosine_ops) WITH (lists = 100);
```

**Hamming distance - added in 0.7.0**

```sql
CREATE INDEX ON items USING ivfflat (embedding bit_hamming_ops) WITH (lists = 100);
```

#### IVFFlat query options

You can specify the number of probes, which is 1 by default.

```sql
SET ivfflat.probes = 10;
```

A higher value provides better recall at the cost of speed. You can set the value to the number of lists for exact nearest neighbor search, at which point the planner won’t use the index.

You can also use `SET LOCAL` inside a transaction to set the number of probes for a single query:

```sql
BEGIN;
SET LOCAL ivfflat.probes = 10;
SELECT ...
COMMIT;
```

## Optimizing index build time

To optimize index build time, consider configuring the following session variables prior to building an index:

- [maintenance_work_mem](#maintenance_work_mem)
- [max_parallel_maintenance_workers](#max_parallel_maintenance_workers)

**maintenance_work_mem**

In Postgres, the `maintenance_work_mem` setting determines the maximum memory allocation for tasks such as `CREATE INDEX`. The default `maintenance_work_mem` value in Neon is set according to your Neon [compute size](/docs/manage/endpoints#how-to-size-your-compute):

| Compute Units (CU) | vCPU | RAM   |  maintenance_work_mem    |
|--------------|------|-------|--------------------------|
| 0.25         | 0.25 | 1 GB  |   64 MB                  |
| 0.50         | 0.50 | 2 GB  |   64 MB                  |
| 1            | 1    | 4 GB  |   67 MB                  |
| 2            | 2    | 8 GB  |   134 MB                 |
| 3            | 3    | 12 GB |   201 MB                 |
| 4            | 4    | 16 GB |   268 MB                 |
| 5            | 5    | 20 GB |   335 MB                 |
| 6            | 6    | 24 GB |   402 MB                 |
| 7            | 7    | 28 GB |   470 MB                 |
| 8            | 8    | 32 GB |   537 MB                 |

To optimize `pgvector` index build time, you can increase the `maintenance_work_mem` setting for the current session with a command similar to the following:  

```sql
SET maintenance_work_mem='10 GB';
```

The recommended setting is your working set size (the size of your tuples for vector index creation). However, your `maintenance_work_mem` setting should not exceed 50 to 60 percent of your compute's available RAM (see the table above). For example, the `maintenance_work_mem='10 GB'` setting shown above has been successfully tested on a 7 CU compute, which has 28 GB of RAM, as 10 GiB is less than 50% of the RAM available for that compute size.

**max_parallel_maintenance_workers**

The `max_parallel_maintenance_workers` sets the maximum number of parallel workers that can be started by a single utility command such as `CREATE INDEX`. By default, the `max_parallel_maintenance_workers` setting is `2`. For efficient parallel index creation, you can increase this setting. Parallel workers are taken from the pool of processes established by `max_worker_processes` (`10`), limited by `max_parallel_workers` (`8`). 

You can increase the `maintenance_work_mem` setting for the current session with a command similar to the following:  

```sql
SET max_parallel_maintenance_workers = 7
```

For example, if you have a 7 CU compute size, you could set `max_parallel_maintenance_workers` to 7, before index creation, to make use of all of the vCPUs available.

## Differences in behaviour between pgvector 0.5.1 and 0.7.0

Differences in behavior in the following corner cases were found during our testing of `pgvector` 0.7.0:

### Distance between a valid and NULL vector

The distance between a valid and `NULL` vector (`NULL::vector`) with `pgvector` 0.7.0 differs from `pgvector` 0.5.1 when using an HNSW or IVFFLAT index, as shown in the following examples: 

**HNSW**

For the following script, comparing the `NULL::vector` to non-null vectors the resulting output changes:

```sql
SET enable_seqscan = off;

CREATE TABLE t (val vector(3));
INSERT INTO t (val) VALUES ('[0,0,0]'), ('[1,2,3]'), ('[1,1,1]'), (NULL);
CREATE INDEX ON t USING hnsw (val vector_l2_ops);

INSERT INTO t (val) VALUES ('[1,2,4]');

SELECT * FROM t ORDER BY val <-> (SELECT NULL::vector);
```

`pgvector` 0.7.0 output:

```
   val   
---------
 [1,1,1]
 [1,2,4]
 [1,2,3]
 [0,0,0]
```

`pgvector` 0.5.1 output:


```
   val   
---------
 [0,0,0]
 [1,1,1]
 [1,2,3]
 [1,2,4]
```

**IVFFLAT**

For the following script, comparing the `NULL::vector` to non-null vectors the resulting output changes:

```sql
SET enable_seqscan = off;

CREATE TABLE t (val vector(3));
INSERT INTO t (val) VALUES ('[0,0,0]'), ('[1,2,3]'), ('[1,1,1]'), (NULL);
CREATE INDEX ON t USING ivfflat (val vector_l2_ops) WITH (lists = 1);

INSERT INTO t (val) VALUES ('[1,2,4]');

SELECT * FROM t ORDER BY val <-> (SELECT NULL::vector);
```

`pgvector` 0.7.0 output:

```sql
   val   
---------
 [0,0,0]
 [1,2,3]
 [1,1,1]
 [1,2,4]
 ```

 `pgvector` 0.5.1 output:

 ```sql
    val   
---------
 [0,0,0]
 [1,1,1]
 [1,2,3]
 [1,2,4]
 ```

### Error messages improvement for invalid literals

If you use an invalid literal value for the `vector` data type, you will now see the following error message:

```sql
SELECT '[4e38,1]'::vector;
ERROR:  "4e38" is out of range for type vector
LINE 1: SELECT '[4e38,1]'::vector;
```
