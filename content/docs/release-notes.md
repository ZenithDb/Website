### Bug fixes

* UI: fix project status live updates using websocket connection.

## 2022-08-02 Storage release

### What's new

* Postgres Compute: install 'uuid-ossp' extension binaries. `CREATE EXTENSION "uuid-ossp"` now works.

* Postgres Compute: add logging for when initializing compute node fails in the 'basebackup' stage.

* Pageserver: avoid busy looping, when deletion from cloud storage is skipped due to failed upload tasks.

* Pageserver: changes to internal management API: merge 'wal_receiver' endpoint with 'timeline_detail'

* Pageserver: changes to internal management API: report physical size with tenant status

## 2022-07-20 Console release

### What's new

* UI: add 'Enable pooling' toggle to the Project's Settings page.
* Control plane: use several instances to serve public API and web UI, which allow doing a zero-downtime deployments.
* API: return `423 Locked` instead of `409 Conflict`, when there is a concurrent operation on project preventing acquiring the project lock.

## 2022-07-19 Storage release

### What's new

* Safekeeper: back up WAL to S3 for disaster recovery.

* Safekeeper: download WAL from S3 on demand.

* Safekeeper: switch to etcd subscriptions to keep pageservers updated about safekeeper status

* Safekeeper: implement JWT authentication in Safekeeper HTTP API.

* Proxy: propagate SASL/SCRAM postgres authentication errors to the clients.

* Postgres Compute: update vendor/postgres to 14.4.

* Postgres Compute: rename custom configuration parameters:
    * `zenith.page_server_connstring` -> `neon.pageserver_connstring`
    * `zenith.zenith_tenant` -> `neon.tenant_id`
    * `zenith.zenith_timeline` -> `neon.timeline_id`
    * `zenith.max_cluster_size` -> `neon.max_cluster_size`
    * `wal_acceptors` -> `safekeepers`

* Control Plane: rename `zenith_admin` role to `cloud_admin`

* Pageserver: implement page service `fullbackup` endpoint that works like basebackup, but also sends relational files.

* Pageserver: allow importing basebackup taken from vanilla postgres or another pageserver via psql copy in protocol.

* Pageserver: fix database size calculation - count not only main fork of the relation, but also VM and FSM.

* Pageserver: update timeline size when DROP DATABASE is executed.

* Pageserver: decrease the number of threads by running gc and compaction in a blocking tokio thread pool.

* Pageserver: switch to per-tenant attach/detach. Download operations of all timelines for one tenant are now grouped together so branches can be used safely with attach/detach.

### Bug fixes

* Postgres Compute: fix CREATE EXTENSION for non-db-owner users

* Safekeeper: fix walreceiver connection selection mechanism:
    * Avoid reconnecting to safekeeper immediately after its failure by limiting candidates to those with fewest connection attempts.
    * Make default `max_lsn_wal_lag` larger, otherwise constant reconnections happen during normal work.
    * Fix `wal_connection_attempts` maintanance, preventing busy loop of reconnections.
