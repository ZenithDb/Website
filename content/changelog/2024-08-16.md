### Autoscaling for Free Plan users

As we move towards GA for Autoscaling, we want all our users &#8212; including those on our Free Plan &#8212; to experience how easily your compute can scale to meet demand.

By default, your primary compute is still set to a fixed 0.5 vCPU compute size, guaranteeing you 24/7 availability for your default branch. With Autoscaling enabled, you can increase your minimum and maximum vCPU to the level you need to handle your anticipated workload: up to 2 vCPU.
