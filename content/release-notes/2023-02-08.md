### What's new

- UI: Updated various UI elements in the Neon Console to rename **Endpoints** to **Compute endpoints**. The term _Endpoint_ was not specific enough to accurately reflect the resource being referred to. A **Compute endpoint** in Neon refers the compute instance that runs PostgreSQL.
- UI: Added a `PRIMARY` badge to identify the primary branch of a Neon project. The badge is visible on the **Branches** page in the Neon Console and in other UI elements that show a project's branches.
- API: Splitted `default_enpoint_settings` and `settings` in `project`. The `default_endpoint_settings` is Postgres specific settings that are applied to project compute endpoints by default. `Settings` are some general projects parameters (e.g. compute quota). You may need to change createProject/updateProject requests code if you've been using these fields.
