## PostgreSQL connection limits

Each PostgreSQL connection creates a new process in the operating system, which consumes resources. For this reason, PostgreSQL limits the number of open connections. Neon permits 100 simultaneous PostgreSQL connections by default with a `max_connections=100` setting, which is the typical default for this parameter. In Neon, a small number of those connections are reserved for administrative purposes. A connection limit of 100 may not be sufficient for some applications. To increase the number of connections that Neon  supports, you can enable connection pooling for the [endpoint](../../reference/glossary/#endpoint) compute instance you use to connect to your database.

## Connection pooling

Some applications open numerous connections, with most eventually becoming inactive. This behavior can often be attributed to database driver limitations or to running many instances of an application. With regular PostgreSQL, new connections are rejected when reaching the `max_connections` limit. To overcome this limitation, Neon supports connection pooling using [PgBouncer](https://www.pgbouncer.org/).

PgBouncer is an open-source connection pooler for PostgreSQL. When an application needs to connect to a database, PgBouncer provides a connection from the pool. Connections in the pool are routed to a smaller number of actual PostgreSQL connections. When a connection is no longer required, it is returned to the pool and is available to be used again. Maintaining a pool of available connections improves performance by reducing the number of connections that need to be created and torn down to service incoming requests. Connection pooling also helps avoid rejected connections. When all connections in the pool are being used, PgBouncer queues a new request until a connection from the pool becomes available.

With connection pooling enabled, Neon can handle up to 1000 concurrent connections. Neon uses `PgBouncer` in `transaction mode`. For limitations associated with `transaction mode`, see [Connection pooling notes and limitations](#connection-pooling-notes-and-limitations). For more information about `PgBouncer`, refer to [https://www.pgbouncer.org/](https://www.pgbouncer.org/).

## Enable connection pooling

In Neon, connection pooling is configured for individual endpoint compute instances. It is disabled by default. You can enable connection pooling when creating or editing an endpoint.

To enable connection pooling for an existing endpoint:

1. Navigate to the [Neon console](https://console.neon.tech/).
2. On the **Dashboard**, select **Endpoints**.
3. Find the endpoint you want to enable pooling for, click the kebab menu in the **Endpoints** table, and select **Edit**.
5. Toggle **Pooler enabled** to the on position.
6. Click **Save**.

You can also enable connection pooling when creating an endpoint. See [Create an endpoint](../../manage/endpoints/#create-an-endpoint).

## Connection pooling notes and limitations

Neon uses PgBouncer in _transaction mode_, which does not support PostgreSQL features such as prepared statements or [LISTEN](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/15/sql-listen.html)/[NOTIFY](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/15/sql-notify.html). For a complete list of limitations, refer to the "_SQL feature map for pooling modes_" section in the [pgbouncer.org Features](https://www.pgbouncer.org/features.html) documentation.

Some clients and applications may require connection pooling. For example, using Prisma Client with PgBouncer from a serverless function requires connection pooling. To ensure that connection pooling is enabled for clients and applications that require it, you can add the `?pgbouncer=true` flag to your Neon connection string, as shown in the following example:

```text
postgres://casey:<password>@ep-square-sea-260584.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech:5432/neondb?pgbouncer=true"
```

Prisma Migrate, however, requires a direct connection to the database, and currently does not support connection pooling with PgBouncer. Attempting to run Prisma Migrate commands in any environment that enables PgBouncer for connection pooling results in the following error:

```text
Error: undefined: Database error
Error querying the database: db error: ERROR: prepared statement "s0" already exists
 ```

You may encounter this error with other applications that require a direct connection to PostgreSQL or applications that are not compatible with PgBouncer in `transaction mode`. In these cases, do not enable connection pooling in Neon.
  
For more information about using Prisma in a PgBouncer-enabled environment, refer to the [Prisma documentation](https://www.prisma.io/docs/guides/performance-and-optimization/connection-management/configure-pg-bouncer#add-pgbouncer-to-the-connection-url).

PostgreSQL features such as prepared statements and [LISTEN](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/15/sql-listen.html)/[NOTIFY](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/15/sql-notify.html) are not supported with connection pooling. For a complete list of limitations, refer to the "_SQL feature map for pooling modes_" section, in the [pgbouncer.org Features](https://www.pgbouncer.org/features.html) documentation.
