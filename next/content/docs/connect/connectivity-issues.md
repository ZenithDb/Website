In most cases, copying a connection string from the Neon **Dashboard** and using it in your project should work as is. However, with older clients and some native PostgreSQL clients, you may receive the following error:

```txt
ERROR: The endpoint ID is not specified. Either upgrade the PostgreSQL client library (libpq) for SNI support or pass the endpoint ID (the first part of the domain name) as a parameter: '&options=project%3D'. See [https://neon.tech/sni](https://neon.tech/sni) for more information.
```

In most cases, this happens if your client library or application does not support the **SNI (Server Name Indication)** mechanism in TLS. See [Details](#details) for more context and [Workarounds](#workarounds) for a list of ways to work around this issue.

## Details

To route incoming connections, we use different domain names for different endpoints. For example, to connect to the endpoint `ep-mute-recipe-239816`, we ask you to connect to `ep-mute-recipe-239816.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech`. However, the PostgreSQL wire protocol does not transfer the server domain name, so we rely on the SNI (Server Name Indication) extension of the `TLS` protocol, which allows a client to indicate what domain name it is attempting to connect to. This is the same mechanism that allows hosting several `https`-enabled websites on a single IP address. `SNI` support was added to the `libpq` (an official PostgreSQL client library) in version 14, released in September 2021. All `libpq`-based clients like Python's `psycopg2` and Ruby's `ruby-pg` should work if the system `libpq`  version is >= 14.

## Workarounds

If you encounter a `Project ID is not specified` error and a library or application upgrade does not help, we provide several fallback options. When SNI domain name information is missing, we need to obtain this information through other means.

### A. Pass the endpoint ID as an option

We support a special connection option named `project`, which you can set to identify the endpoint you are connecting to. More specifically, you can set pass `options=project%3Dmy-endpoint-123456` as a `GET` parameter in the connection string. The `%3D` is a URL-encoded `=`.

For example, instead of the following connection string:

```txt
postgres://<user>:<password>@my-endpoint-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/main
```

you can use that one:

```txt
postgres://<user>:<password>@my-endpoint-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/main?options=project%3Dmy-endpoint-123456
```

This option is expected to work if your application or library permits it to be set. But not all of them do, especially in the case of GUI applications.

### B. Use libpq key=value syntax in the database field

If your application or client is `libpq`-based and you can't easily upgrade the library, such as when the library is compiled inside of a pre-built application, you can use the fact that `libpq` permits adding options to the database name. So instead of only the database name, you can specify:

```txt
dbname=main options=project=<endpoint_id>
```

This workaround is expected to work with all `libpq`-based applications.

### C. Set verify-full for golang-based clients

If your application or service uses golang PostgreSQL clients like `pgx` and `lib/pg`, you can set `sslmode=verify-full,` which causes `SNI` information to be sent. Most likely, this behavior is not intentional but happens inadvertently due to the golang's TLS library API design.

### D. Specify the endpoint ID in the password field

You can specify the endpoint ID in the password field as a last resort. So, instead of your actual password, you can define a string consisting of the endpoint and the password. For example:

```txt
project=ep-mute-recipe-239816;<password>
```

This approach is the least secure of all the recommended workarounds. It causes the authentication method to be downgraded from `scram-sha-256` (never transfers a plain text password) to `password` (transfers a plain text password) on the fly. The connection is still over a TLS-encrypted connection, so the amount of security is the same as with `https` websites. However, we intend deprecate this option when most libraries and applications adopt `SNI`.
