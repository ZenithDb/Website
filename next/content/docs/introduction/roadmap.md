The Neon **Limited Preview** started in February, 2022, and was made available to a small number of select users and friends.

On June 15th, 2022, the Neon team announced the **Technical Preview**, making Neon available to a wider audience. During the Technical Preview, thousands of users are able to try Neon's Free Tier. For more information, see [Technical Preview Free Tier](/docs/reference/technical-preview-free-tier).

On December 6th, 2022, Neon released its branching feature and dropped the invite gate, welcoming everyone to try Neon's Free Tier.

The Neon team aims to launch paid tiers in Q1 2023.
