A project is the top-level object in the Neon object hierarchy. Tier limits define how many projects you can create. Neon's free tier permits one project per Neon account.

A Neon project is created with the following resources by default:

- A root branch called `main`. You can create child branches from the root branch or from a previously created branch. For more information, see [Branches](../branches).
- A single read-write endpoint. An endpoint is the compute instance associated with a branch. For more information, see [Endpoints](../branches).
- A default database, called `neondb`, which resides in the project's root branch.
- A default PostgreSQL user that takes its name from your Neon account (the Google, GitHub, or partner account that you registered with).
- A `web_access` PostgreSQL user, which is used by the Neon [SQL Editor](../../get-started-with-neon/query-with-neon-sql-editor) and for [passwordless connections](../../connect/passwordless-connect).

## Create a project

To create a Neon project:

1. Navigate to the [Neon Console](https://console.neon.tech).
2. If you are creating your very first project, click **Create your first project**. Otherwise, click **New Project**.
3. Specify a name, a PostgreSQL version, a region, and click **Create Project**.

Upon creating a project, you are presented with a dialog that provides your connection details for the project, including your password. The password is required to connect to databases in the project from a client or application. Store your password in a safe location.

<Admonition type="important">
After closing the connection information dialog, your password is no longer accessible. If you forget or misplace your password, your only option is to reset it. For password reset instructions, see [Users](../users).
</Admonition>

## Edit a project

Only changing the project name and enabling or disabling connection pooling are permitted when editing a project.

To edit a Neon project:

1. Navigate to the [Neon Console](https://console.neon.tech).
2. Select the project that you want to edit.
3. Select **Settings** > **General**.
4. Make your changes and click **Save**.

## Delete a project

Deleting a project is a permanent action, which also deletes any endpoints, branches, databases, and users that belong to the project.

To delete a project:

1. Navigate to the [Neon Console](https://console.neon.tech).
2. Select the project that you want to delete.
3. Select **Settings** > **General**.
4. Click **Delete project.**
5. On the confirmation dialog, click **Delete**.

## Manage projects with the Neon API

Project actions performed in the Neon Console can also be performed using the Neon API. The following examples demonstrate how to create, view, and delete projects using the Neon API. For other project-related API methods, refer to the [Neon API reference](https://neon.tech/api-reference/v2/).

<Admonition type="note">
The API examples that follow may not show all of the user-configurable request body attributes that are available to you. To view all of the attributes for a particular method, refer to method's request body schema in the [Neon API reference](https://neon.tech/api-reference/v2/).
</Admonition>

The `jq` option specified in each example is an optional third-party tool that formats the `JSON` response, making it easier to read. For information about this utility, see [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/).

### Prerequisites

A Neon API request requires an API key. For information about obtaining an API key, see [Create an API key](../../manage/api-keys/#create-an-api-key). In the cURL examples shown below, `$NEON_API_KEY` is specified in place of an actual API key, which you must provide when making a Neon API request.

### Create a project with the API

The following Neon API method creates a project. The [Neon Free Tier](../../introduction/technical-preview-free-tier/) permits one project per account. To view the API documentation for this method, refer to the [Neon API reference](https://neon.tech/api-reference/v2/#/Project/createProject).

```text
POST /projects 
```

The API method appears as follows when specified in a cURL command. The `myproject` name value is a user-specified name for the project.

```bash
curl 'https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/projects' \
  -H 'Accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer $NEON_API_KEY' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
  "project": {
    "name": "myproject"
  }
}' | jq
```

Response:

The response includes information about the roles, the default database, the root branch (`main`), and the read-write endpoint that is created with the project.
