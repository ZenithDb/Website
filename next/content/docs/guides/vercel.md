Next.js by Vercel is an open-source web development framework that enables React-based web applications. This topic describes how to create a Neon project and access it from a Next.js application.

To create a Neon project and access it from a Next.js application:

1. [Create a Neon project](#create-a-neon-project)
2. [Create a Next.js project](#create-a-nextjs-project)
3. [Add a PostgreSQL client to your app](#add-a-postgresql-client-to-your-app)
4. [Add your Neon connection details](#add-your-neon-connection-details)
5. [Connect to the Neon database](#connect-to-the-neon-database)

## Create a Neon project

If you do not have one already, create a Neon project. Save your connection details including your password. They are required when defining connection settings.

1. Navigate to the [Projects](https://console.neon.tech/app/projects) page in the Neon Console.
2. Click **New Project**.
3. Specify a name, a PostgreSQL version, a region, and click **Create Project**.

For additional information about creating projects, see [Set up a project](/docs/get-started-with-neon/setting-up-a-project).

## Create a Next.js project

Create a Next.js project if you do not have one. For instructions, see [Create a Next.js App](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/create-nextjs-app/setup), in the Vercel documentation.

## Add a PostgreSQL client to your app

Add a PostgreSQL client to your app, such as `Postgres.js`. For instructions, refer to the [postgres.js Getting started](https://www.npmjs.com/package/postgres).

## Add your Neon connection details

Add your Neon connection string to your `.env` file.

```shell
DATABASE_URL=postgres://<user>:<password>@<endpoint_hostname>:<port>/<database>
```

where:

- `<user>` is the database user.
- `<password>` is the database user's password, which is provided to you when you create a project.
- `<endpoint_hostname>` the hostname of the branch endpoint. The endpoint hostname has an `ep-` prefix and appears similar to this: `ep-tight-salad-272396.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech`.
- `<port>` is the Neon port number. The default port number is `5432`.
- `<database>` is the name of the database. The default Neon database is `neondb`

You can find all of the connection details listed above, except for your password,  in the **Connection Details** widget on the Neon **Dashboard**. For more information, see [Connect from any application](../../connect/connect-from-any-app). If you have misplaced your password, see [Reset a password](../../manage/users/#reset-a-password).

## Connect to the Neon database

From your API handlers or server functions, connect to the Neon database with the PostgreSQL client and your Neon connection details. For example:

```javascript pages/api/hello_worlds.js
import postgres from 'postgres';

const sql = postgres(process.env.DATABASE_URL);

const result = await sql.unsafe(req.body);
```
