### What's new

- Control Plane: Implemented connection pooling support for Neon projects, allowing Neon to support a greater number of connections. For information about enabling connection pooling for a Neon project, see [Connection pooling](/docs/get-started-with-neon/connection-pooling/).
- API: Added a `pooler_enabled` property to the [project update API call](https://neon.tech/api-reference/#/Project/branchCreate) to indicate whether or not connection pooling is enabled.

### Bug fixes

- API: Fixed several bugs that could cause intermittent 409 responses, which indicate a request conflict with the current state of the target resource.
