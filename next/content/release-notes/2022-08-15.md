- UI: Changed the display status of operations waiting in the queue from `In progress` to `Scheduling`.
- UI: Disabled controls that incorrectly remained enabled while the Neon project was in a transitive state.
- Control Plane: Set `max_replication_write_lag` to `15 MB` to tune the backpressure mechanism and improve PostgresSQL responsiveness under load.
