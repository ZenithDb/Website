### Features

- Compute: Added support for the the PostgreSQL `postgis-sfcgal` extension. For more information about PostgreSQL extensions supported by Neon, see [PostgreSQL extensions](https://neon.tech/docs/reference/pg-extensions/).
- Compute: Added support for [International Components for Unicode (ICU)](https://icu.unicode.org/), which permits defining collation objects that use ICU as the collation provider. For example:

    ```sql
    CREATE COLLATION german (provider = icu, locale = 'de');
    ```

- Proxy: Reduced the latency experienced when establishing multiple connections with Neon.
