      <p>
        No real-world database has constant demand. To some extent, all modern applications
        experience variable traffic patterns; for some applications, demand is clearly variable. For
        example:
      </p>
      <List items={items} />
      <p>
        Variable load patterns are common, but <strong>traditional managed databases</strong>{' '}
        require provisioning a fixed amount of CPU and memory. To avoid degraded performance or even
        outages, it is standard practice to provision for peak traffic, which means{' '}
        <strong>
          paying for peak capacity 24/7 — even though it&apos;s needed only a fraction of the time.
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Neon&apos;s serverless architecture</strong> eliminates the need for provisioning a
        fixed amount of CPU and memory. Instead of overpaying for peak capacity that is rarely
        needed, Neon dynamically adjusts compute resources to match actual workload demands.{' '}
        <strong>This means you only pay for what you use.</strong>
